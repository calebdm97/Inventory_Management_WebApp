# Inventory Management WebApp
This is an on going project the I started on my own to help better manage inventory for the IT department that I work for.

The reason it is being stored here is because it is a project that was not requested by anyone else in the department and is not seen as a doable task or a worth while one.

Disclaimer: I have no idea how long it will take me to make it or what languages and frameworks I will use and it is possible that it will change a few times through development as I research the best solution, or the solution that I can reasonable accomplish.
